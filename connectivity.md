# Connectivity
The system is designed to be used with a 12 volt power over ethernet radio antenna to stream data in real time to the cloud to be processed.
Our system used the [Ubiqiuti airMAX Bullet AC Dual-Band Radio](https://store.ui.com/collections/wireless/products/bullet-ac-ip67-1?_pos=3&_sid=166db66cb&_ss=r) 

the ethernet line for the radio can also be connected to a laptop to verify that the system is functional during deployment

## possible improvements 
- the radio we used can be used as part of a mesh network, multiple systems could be used to survey a large ammount of water at once, and could possibly be paired with other remote measurement devices.
