## Organization
The enclosure contains a 3D printed bracket with heat set standoff inserts to keep the [raspberry pi](./Raspberry-pi) and [camera](./camera) fixed in place during use.

## Cables
The enclosure is connected by an ethernet cable. The cable connects the raspberry pi to the [networking equipment](../connectivity) and to the [power system](./Power).

### power
the ethernet cable supplies 12 volt [power over ethernet](./POE) to the box, but because the raspberry pi is run off of 5v power the power lines are run through a high efficiency step down circuit.

## Waterproofing
The enclosure uses a gasket to keep the seal around the hinge waterproofed. The ethernet is waterproofed using a water resistant bulkhead.
## improvements
- batteries inside the enclosure
	- decreases buoyancy of the enclosure so a cinderblock isn't needed to keep it on the riverbed
	-
