## Types of camera
The raspberry pi can be used with several camera models, for our original prototype we used the [high quality camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera). Any other model could be used, though each will have distinct advantages ad disadvantages.
### infrared cameras
The raspberry pi [camera module 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-3/) can be bought in a full spectrum "noIR" (no infrared filter) version. Infrared light is blocked by water much more effectively than the visible spectrum so the scene would need to be lit artificially.
