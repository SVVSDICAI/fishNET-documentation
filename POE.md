# Power over Ethernet
the system uses unofficial power over Ethernet to provide power to both the [network equipment](./connectivity) and to the [Raspberry pi](./Raspberry-pi)

12 volt power is spliced into the Ethernet cable from the battery and sent to the radio and [underwater enclosure](./enclosure).  Within the box, the 12 volt power is converted into 5 volts by a circuit using the {TODO get the name of the chip from the box}.  This method is used instead of a standard POE injector to improve system efficiency.
